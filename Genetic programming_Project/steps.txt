1- create samples expression tree with variables
2- compute their value by given inputs 
3- compute fitness function by having original value and computed value(fitness function is mse or rmse) if the condition was satisfied we exit
4-(roulette wheel ) compute pi = fi/sum of all f 
5- compute expected pi = number of samples in generation * pi 
6- select n samples with any order you like whether its random or not it is based on expected 
7- excute cross over method on both of them now again we new childs
8- excute mutation on each child indvidualy
9- now we have a new generation we go to step 2 again
